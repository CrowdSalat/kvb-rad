## nextbike api

This project uses the nextbike api for cologne: [https://api.nextbike.net/maps/nextbike-official.json?city=14]. *Alternatively there is a GBFS (General Bikeshare Feed Specification) conform api under: [https://api.nextbike.net/maps/gbfs/v1/nextbike_kg/gbfs.json]*

The model classes for json were scaffolded with the vscode plugin [Paste JSON as Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quicktype.quicktype) from [Quicktype](https://github.com/quicktype/quicktype).
